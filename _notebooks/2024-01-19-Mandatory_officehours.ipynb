    "Version I calls the GetPrediction procedure once for each element of idList, or four times total. Since each call requires 1 minute of execution time, version I requires approximately 4 minutes to execute. Version II calls the GetPrediction procedure twice for each element of idList, and then again in the final display statement. This results in the procedure being called nine times, requiring approximately 9 minutes of execution time.\n",

    "Both versions aim to achieve the same result, which is to find and display the highest predicted score among the players in idList. However, Version I directly updates the highest score (topScore), while Version II updates the ID of the player with the highest score (topID) and then retrieves the predicted score for that player. Version II essentially avoids calling GetPrediction multiple times for the same ID.\n",
