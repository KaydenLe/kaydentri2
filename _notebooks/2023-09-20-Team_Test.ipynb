    "<h4> Some benefits of being in a team include that there are more perspectives to add on a topic/problem, so that you can create a solution that is true to most point of views. Not only that but the team members can learn from one another. When people with different skills and knowledge work together, they have the opportunity to acquire new skills and expand their knowledge base. When working in a team you can accomplish more in a quicker amount of time.\n",

    "<h3> Describe how you will facilitate communication amongst group members. </h3>\n",
    "<h4> in order to facilitate communication amongst group members, we must establish clear goals and objectives. To add onto this, by assigning a team leader/scrum master will help keep the flow of work smooth, as the team leader will overlook completion of the tasks and participation of each group members. By having regular meetings and check-ins, we can make sure that the work is up to date with completion, and that all members of the group are on the same page.</h4>\n",

    "<h4> We can hold each person accountable for their portion of the work by having dates where we will hold meetings/check-ins. This gives a partial completion date for the group members at certain times which will make sure that the project and work will be completed efficiently at the correct time. By holding these check-ins, the group and team leader will be able to see who isn't up-to-date on their work, meaning that they will need to catch up. The more check-ins that we will have, the better the quality of work we will have for the final project, as well as it being submitted on time.</h4>"
