    "Down loaded all the programs for CSP such as VSCODE and homebrew. A lot of errors occurred during the process of installing and setting up all our tools. For example, a lot of the commands on the setup instructions didn't work for my mac. I attempted troubleshooting by asking peers, more experienced coders, attending office hours, and researching on my own time. I think a lot of the issue was that I had never used platforms like terminal, and I'm more used to using *HTML, CSS,* and basic *python* I ended up figuring out how to run *python*, *pip*, *brew* and the *make* command, and it taught me how to problem solve without knowing exactly what I'm doing. As I grow and learn as a computer scientist, I will pick up on these troubleshooting skills and e able to solve problems simply by expirementing. "

Started a new reposoritory and trasnfered all my work but it was having trouble creating a make. The make had many errors such as having an air for a markdown that didn't exist. I resolved this problem by going to week 1 hacks and putting in the make line in order to have the make to work. I don't have theme because I don't won't to deal with the problems with one until my quiz works. This whole week I basically had to start a new repository from scratch and added the quiz and copy and pasted the home from the old repository. I asked my peers and teachers for help which resolved the problem but I did have to create a new repository that set me back and I did have a lot work cut out for me on the weekend."

Creating an API took the longest because we didn't know weather or not if we should start from scratch or base it off a exsisting API. We had to create the API manually but at first we did consider basing it off a NFL api because that was easier. There wasn't many issues but just a lot of thought was put into specific things."

It was a pain getting it to work and I had to download more thing such as postman. I had to connect it and get it off a localhost. This week was also night at the museum so I really had to finish everything and get ready to finally present the project. I kept running into issues such as my API not working and the local host not working. Sometimes the server would not work. I also had to spend a lot of time on unbuntu and aws trying to get the backend situated with that. I did also need help from many peers but there is no way I could work on the backend alone so I had to ask Hau if he could get the website for the backend of a localhost. I eventually connected the backend with the frontend and on wendsday night we got to work and put all the stats in for each play into the website. Switiching between the backend and the frontend was mostly the biggest pain."
